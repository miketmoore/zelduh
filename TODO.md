# TODO

* Prevent clipping through obstacles - appens when moving faster (dash) and when weapon is drawn
* Prevent arrow from changing direction with player after shot
* Bomb
* Dash should end after a certain amount of ticks
* Player should move back like enemy when hit (so it does not clip)
* Sometimes I see the arrow or sword sprite in the lower left corner. I think this is the default when a bug occurs, where the player is trying to attack through an obstacle.
* Pushing puzzle box should move incrementally, not all at once
* Add "appear" animations for all items and enemies
* Add "hit" animation when entity is not dead
* Currently, the total moves when hit serves as a counter until the next hit will register. What about when an enemy collides with an obstacle and is still very close to the player, then the player hits again? Maybe there should be a mechanism that prevents hits from working.
