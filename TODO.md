# TODO

* Prevent clipping through obstacles - appens when moving faster (dash) and when weapon is drawn
* Prevent arrow from changing direction with player after shot
* Bomb
* Dash should end after a certain amount of ticks
* Player should move back like enemy when hit (so it does not clip)
* Sometimes I see the arrow or sword sprite in the lower left corner. I think this is the default when a bug occurs, where the player is trying to attack through an obstacle.
* Pushing puzzle box should move incrementally, not all at once
